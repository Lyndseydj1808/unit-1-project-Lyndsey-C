        Hi! My name is Lyndsey. I'm a software development student and, most
        importantly, a mother. I created Little Creatures Feel Big as a
        heart-led project to help my own children learn about emotional
        intelligence and build a foundation of self-worth.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project has allowed me to tie together the front-end fundamentals
        I've been mastering. Moving from basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS to building a
        dynamic, state-driven React application. By focusing on reusable
        components and clean data structures, I've built a scalable application
        that I hope to expand on and grow as my children do.{" "}
